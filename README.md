Quandl API for Python
=====================
Basic wrapper to return datasets from the Quandl website as Pandas dataframe objects with a timeseries index, or as a numpy array. This allows interactive manipulation of the results via IPython or storage of the datasets using Pandas I/O functions. You will need a familarity with [pandas](http://pandas.pydata.org/) to get the most out of this.

See the [Quandl API](http://www.quandl.com/api) for more information.

Installation
============
You will also need numpy and pandas before using the Quandl API

    pip install numpy pandas Quandl


Usage
=====
Usage is simple and mirrors the functionality found at [Quandl/API](http://www.quandl.com/api).

A request with a full list of options would be the following.

```python
data = Quandl.get('PRAGUESE/PX', authtoken='xxxxxx', trim_start='2001-01-01',
                  trim_end='2010-01-01', collapse='annual',
                  transformation='rdiff', rows=4, returns='numpy')
```

All options beyond specifying the dataset (PRAUGESE/PX) are optional,though it is helpful to specify an authtoken at 
least once to increase download limits.

You can then view the dataframe with `data.head()`.

See the [pandas documentation](http://pandas.pydata.org/) for a wealth of options on data manipulation.

Authtokens are saved as pickled files in the local directory so it is unnecessary to enter them more than once,
unless you change your working directory. To replace simply save the new token or delete the `authtoken.p` file.


## Search Example
Using the search function you can search Quandl, specifying what sources to search, and what page you wish to show.

	Quandl.search(query = "Search terms", source = "Source you wish to search", page = 1)

An example of searching for datasets having to do with oil: 

	python
	import Quandl
	datasets = Quandl.search('OIL')
	datasets[0]


will output:

	{u'code': u'NSE/OIL',
	 u'colname': [u'Date',
  	 u'Open',
  	 u'High',
  	u'Low',
  	u'Last',
  	u'Close',
  	u'Total Trade Quantity',
  	u'Turnover (Lacs)'],
 	u'desc': u'Historical prices for Oil India Limited (OIL), (ISIN: INE274J01014),  	 National Stock Exchange of India.',
 	u'freq': u'daily',
 	u'name': u'Oil India Limited'}


## Get Example
An example of creating a pandas time series for IBM stock data, with a weekly frequency:

```python
data = Quandl.get('GOOG/NYSE_IBM', collapse='weekly')
data.head()
```

will output

```
No authentication tokens found,usage will be limited

```


### Multisets

Quandl's [multisets](http://www.quandl.com/help/multisets) allows you to create a collection of data, from any column of any dataset on Quandl, and download it as one dataset.

If you wanted to compare the closing prices for Apple and Microsoft, you would obtain the two Quandl codes:

`GOOG/NASDAQ_AAPL`

`GOOG/NASDAQ_MSFT`

Append the column you wish to get with a `.`, and put them into an array.

`['GOOG/NASDAQ_AAPL.4','GOOG/NASDAQ_MSFT.4']`

Just make a normal get call with the array passed to get, and your multiset will be returned.

`data= Quandl.get(['GOOG/NASDAQ_AAPL.4','GOOG/NASDAQ_MSFT.4'])`

Which outputs:

```
No authentication tokens found: usage will be limited.
See www.quandl.com/api for more information.
Returning Dataframe for  [u'GOOG.NASDAQ_AAPL.4', u'GOOG.NASDAQ_MSFT.4']

        GOOG.NASDAQ_AAPL - Close  GOOG.NASDAQ_MSFT - Close

1997-08-21        6.00                     17.23
1997-08-22        5.91                     17.16
1997-08-25        5.77                     17.06
1997-08-26        5.56                     16.88

```


## Push Example
You can now upload your own data to Quandl through the Python package.

At this time the only accepted format is a date indexed Pandas DataSeries.

Things to do before you upload:

* Make an account and set your authentication token within the package with the Quandl.auth() function.
* Get your data into a data frame with the dates in the first column.
* Pick a code for your dataset - only capital letters, numbers and underscores are acceptable.

Then call the following to push the data:

```python
Quandl.push(data, code='TEST', name='Test', desc='test')
```

All parameters but desc are necessary

If you wish to override the existing set at code `TEST` add `override=True`.

Uploading a pandas DataSeries with random data:

```python
import pandas
import numpy

index = ['Dec 12 2296', 'Dec 21 1998', 'Oct 9 2000', 'Oct 19 2001',
         'Oct 30 2003', 'Nov 12 2003']
data = pandas.DataFrame(numpy.random.randn(6, 3), index=index,
                        columns=['D', 'B', 'C'])
print Quandl.push(data, code='F32C', name='Test', desc='test',
                  authtoken='xxxxxx')
```

Will print the link to your newly uploaded data.


Recommended Usage
================
The IPython notebook is an excellent python environment for interactive data work. Spyder is also a superb IDE for analysis and more numerical work.

I would suggest downloading the data in raw format in the highest frequency possible and preforming any data manipulation
in pandas itself.

See [this link](http://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/dev/timeseries.html) for more information about timeseries in pandas.
